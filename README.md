## 📌 About the Project

Air pollution is one of India's most critical public health challenges. PM2.5 — fine particulate matter — causes millions of premature deaths annually. Accurate short-term forecasting is essential for issuing health advisories and informing policy decisions.

**The challenge:** Given 10 hours of past atmospheric data across India's spatial grid, predict PM2.5 concentrations for the next **16 hours** — without access to future meteorological data (autoregressive inference).

Traditional numerical solvers like **WRF-Chem** take 45–90 minutes per forecast case. Our model does it in **~0.8 seconds** — a **>3000× speedup** — with less than 20% SMAPE degradation relative to the physical solver.

---

## 🌐 Physics Background

The governing equation for atmospheric pollutant transport:

```
∂C/∂t  +  u·∇C  =  ∇·(K∇C)  +  E  −  λC
```

Where `C` = PM2.5 concentration, `u` = wind velocity, `K` = turbulent diffusion, `E` = emissions, `λ` = chemical decay.

**Why standard deep learning fails here:**

| Physics Problem | Standard DL Failure | Our Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Spatiotemporal Transport | CNNs are spatially memoryless, fail to capture advection | 3-Layer ConvLSTM tracking 10-hour advection history |
| Extreme Events | Plain MSE ignores PM2.5 spikes (episodes = only 5.6% of data) | Episode-Aware Loss via STL Decomposition |
| Emission Scaling | Log-normal distributions span >10 orders of magnitude | Hard physics constraints: log1p + 1e9 scaling |

**Total parameters: 10.01M**

### Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| **Batched Encoder (B\*T)** | All timesteps in one GPU call — ~10× faster than loop |
| **Last-frame skip** | Preserves most recent spatial state (mean dilutes recent info) |
| **3-Layer ConvLSTM** | Recurrent memory is essential — removing it degrades error by +68% |
| **Dual Attention** | Captures both "when" (temporal) and "which feature" (channel) matters |
| **5D Positional Embeddings** | Provides boundary-layer evolution context across the 10-hour window |

## 🎭 Episode Detection — STL Decomposition

Pollution episodes represent only **5.6% of all pixels** but are the most critical for public health. Standard loss functions ignore them.

```python
# Step 1: Remove trend (24hr moving average)
trend = uniform_filter1d(data, size=24)

# Step 2: Remove daily seasonal pattern
seasonal = hourly_average[t % 24]

# Step 3: Residual anomaly
residual = data - trend - seasonal

# Step 4: Mark as episode if residual > μ + 1.5σ
episode_mask = (residual > res_mean + 1.5 * res_std)
```

These episode pixels are upweighted **7×** in the loss function.

## 📉 Loss Function

```
L = RMSE_logz  +  0.30 × SMAPE  +  0.15 × (1 − ρ)  +  7.0 × MSE_episode
```

| Term | Weight | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `RMSE_logz` | 0.55 | Primary reconstruction in log space |
| `SMAPE` | 0.30 | Scale-invariant % error — direct competition metric surrogate |
| `1 − ρ` | 0.15 | Pearson correlation — preserves spatial pollution patterns |
| `MSE_episode` | **7.0×** | Heavy focus on extreme pollution events |

> **Note:** SMAPE ε = 0.1. The competition formula uses `0.5×(|y|+|ŷ|)` denominator. Using ε=1.0 (default) heavily dampens low-concentration errors.

## 🌍 What the Model Learned

The attention weights reveal the model autonomously discovered real atmospheric physics:

**1. Biogenic Dominance (3.1×)**
During July monsoons, the model assigns 3.1× higher attention to biogenic/NMVOC channels — accurately emulating SOA formation when anthropogenic transport is suppressed.

**2. Spatial Teleconnection: Punjab → Bangladesh**
Attention networks discovered non-local correlations at +14–16 hour lead times, perfectly matching westerly jet transport mechanics — without being explicitly told.

**3. Tendency Shift over Forecast Horizon**
For hours 1–4, model relies on recent PM2.5 tendencies. For longer horizons, it correctly shifts attention to fundamental meteorological drivers (wind, PBLH, temperature).

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **December winter fog:** Deep winter fog causes boundary-layer collapse — model shows residual prediction bias in Dec_16.
- **Autoregressive error accumulation:** Phase 2 inference uses model's own predictions as next-step input. Errors compound over the 16-hour horizon, especially beyond hour 12.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- **3 months:** Scale to 2015–2022 dataset for interannual ENSO robustness
- **6 months:** Implement Graph Neural Networks on WRF mesh for coastal/orographic boundaries (Western Ghats)
- **Operational goal:** Deploy as a real-time FastAPI microservice for sub-hourly AQI nowcasting within India's National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)

### Kaggle Setup
1. Add competition dataset: `anrf-aise-hack-phase-2-theme-2-pollution-forecasting-iitd`
2. Verify paths in CONFIG block:
```python
BASE_PATH = "/kaggle/input/.../raw"
TEST_PATH = "/kaggle/input/.../test_in"

### Config to Tune
```python
ENSEMBLE_SEEDS    = [42, 137]  # add more seeds for better ensemble
HIDDEN_DIM        = 192        # increase for capacity (watch VRAM)
EPISODE_MSE_BOOST = 7.0        # raise if episode SMAPE is high
EPOCHS            = 55         # increase with more compute
```
